           K-Finance was established to fill in the gap of financing to the people in the low income bracket, operating in the informal sector that was traditionally not financed by the formal financial sector, mostly commercial banks. Banks have traditionally been unwilling to provide loans to low income entrepreneurs working in the informal sector due to the perceived risks. It is commonly understood this sector of the market is characterized with people with very low income, low education or completely illiterate, no collateral, no credit history and they are not employed by anybody other than themselves.
       </p>

      <p class="lead">
          These characteristics make lending to low income earners in the informal sector highly risk. Due to lack of reliable credit finance, the struggling entrepreneurs find themselves trapped in a vicious cycle of borrowing from local money lenders/shylocks who demand extortionist interest rates. As a result a huge size of the population is yoked in poverty. On the other hand, this market segment constitutes a huge population of Tanzania that can’t be easily ignored in the quest for sustainable meaningful economic development of the country.
      </p>


       <p class="lead">
           K-Finance’s vision was partly inspired by the ground breaking work of Mohammed Yunus, the visionary behind the microfinance movement, who established that the poor could reliably repay their loans and could use the loans to grow their businesses. Taking advantage of the ground space created by the financial sector reform initiated by the United Republic of Tanzania since 1991, it was conceptualized to establish a friendly MFI that would provide financial products and services tailored to the unique needs and limitations of the low income entrepreneurs working in the informal sector.
       </p>


       <p class="lead paragraphA p-3 " >
           It was decided to establish an MFI that would consolidate the financial and /business skills/ mentoring needs of the small scale enterprises wishing to grow. It was figured out that what most of the people needed was a ‘kick in the back’ through strategic financing and mentoring/ training in order to translate their beautiful dreams into productive enterprises and, consequently, contribute to the national efforts at wealth creation, poverty alleviation and socio-economic development agenda.
